# simple commands example
# note: you have to name the dict 'commands'

commands = {
    'foo': "int i; for(i=0; i<$0; i++){putchar('f');putchar('o');putchar('o');}",
        # $0 will be replaced with the first argument passed to foo
        # this thig is nice, but it implies you can't use $ symbol
        # well only capitalist pigs uses that symbol so no problem :P

}


# example:

# line:
# foo 3

# output:
# foo foo foo
